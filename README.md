The quiz uses a branching logic system where:

1. Each answer leads to a specific next question
2. Questions adapt based on previous responses
3. Results match you with a specific CSE G1 character
4. Multiple paths can lead to different character matches

## Character Categories

The quiz can match you with various CSE G1 personalities including:

- The Driving Enthusiast
- The Cricket Pro
- The Social Media Star
- The Backend Developer
- The Classification Expert
- And more!
